# Overview

This is a guess the number game. The objective is to guess the random number within the range provided within a specific number of attempts. There are 3 difficulties easy, normal, and hard, and there is also an option to free play, this option allows the user to play the game with their selected range and number of attempts. At the end of the game, the program will generate a text file with the number of wins in each category, excluding free play.

I did this to demonstrate how Java can be used with Visual Studio Code, and to understand the basics of file writing and loops.

In the future I want to add more phrases when the user is close to the number to guess, and I also want to add a way for users to load their data.
